Why do we have a <modelName>.model and <modelName>.mongo?

The main reason for this is to hide mongo and mongoose implementation.

The .mongo.js files defines the schema and export the model. In the .model.js files the model's data access functions are defined, using mongoose functions.

To get or set data from/to database, we use the .model.js functions

Working this way, if the database changes from mongo to SQL we just need to change the .model.js implementation, instead of re-creating all the model logic
